Adam Bedingfield's first portfolio

About:

This is my first website I have ever built from scratch. It is a portfolio page that gives a little bit of information about me, future projects I plan to make, and a way to contact me.

Software/languages used:

Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, Github, Github Pages

Extra:

I found making this to be interesting, seeing my own work come to life is awesome in itself. This is only the beginning and I know there are some kinks that need to be worked out and optimized over time but for its current state, I'm prety happy with it.
